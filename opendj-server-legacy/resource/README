How To Install the PTC Windchill Directory Server
=====================

If you are reading this page, you may have already installed WindchillDS.  The
primary way to install WindchillDS is by using the PTC PSI installation tool.
This is a convenient Graphical Interface tool that leads you through the
installation process.  The tool allows you to install WindchillDS as part of a
Windchill install or allows you to perform a stand-alone WindchillDS
installation.  Or, you can also install Java along with the WindchillDS
installation.  For more information about installing WindchillDS, please refer
to the Windchill Help Center at
http://support.ptc.com/cs/help/windchill_hc/wc102_hc/

Before You Install
------------------
A Java SE 7 or later runtime environment must be installed either before
WindchillDS, or as part of the WindchillDS installation.
It is recommended that your system have at least 200MB of disk space and 512MB
of free memory to run WindchillDS for a minimal installation.
